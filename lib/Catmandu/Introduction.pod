=head1 Introduction

Catmandu is a data processing toolkit developed as part of the L<LibreCat|http://librecat.org> project.  Catmandu provides the command line client L<catmandu> and a suite of tools to ease the import, storage, retrieval, export and transformation of data. For instance, to transform a CSV file into JSON use the command:

    $ catmandu convert JSON to CSV < data.json

Or, to store a YAML file into an ElasticSearch database type (requires L<Catmandu::ElasticSearch>):

    $ catmandu import YAML to ElasticSearch --index_name demo < test.yml

To export all the data from an Solr search engine into JSON type (requires L<Catmandu::Solr>):

    $ catmandu export Solr --url http://localhost:8983/solr to JSON

With Catmandu one can import OAI-PMH records in your application (requires L<Catmandu::OAI>):

    $ catmandu convert OAI --url http://biblio.ugent.be/oai --set allFtxt

and export records into formats such as JSON, YAML, CSV, XLS, RDF and many more.

Catmandu also provides the small scripting language "Fix" to manipulate data, extract parts of your dataset and transform records. For instance, rename fields  with the L<move_field|Catmandu::Fix::move_field> Fix command:

    $ catmandu convert JSON --fix 'move_field(title,my_title)' < data.json

In the example above, we renamed all the C<title> fields in the dataset into the C<my_title> field.

One can also work on deeply nested data. E.g. create a deeply nested data structure with the C<move_field> Fix command:

    $ catmandu convert JSON --fix 'move_field(title,my.deeply.nested.title)' < data.json

In this example we moved the field C<title> into the field C<my>, which contains a (sub)field C<deeply>, which contains a (sub)field C<nested>.

Catmandu was originally created by librarians for librarians. We process a lot of metadata especially library metadata in formats such as MARC, MAB2 and MODS. With the following command we can extract data from a marc record and to store it into the title field (requires L<Catmandu::MARC>):

    $ catmandu convert MARC --fix 'marc_map(245,title)' < data.mrc

Or, in case only the 245a subfield is needed write:

    $ catmandu convert MARC --fix 'marc_map(245a,title)' < data.mrc

When processing data a lot of Fix commands could be required. It wouldn't be very practical to type them all on the command line. By creating a Fix script which contains all the fix commands complicated data transformations can be created. For instance, if the file C<myfixes.txt> contains:

     marc_map(245a,title)
     marc_map(100a,author.$append)
     marc_map(700a,author.$append)
     marc_map(020a,isbn)
     replace_all(isbn,'[^0-9-]+','')

then they can be executed on a MARC file using this command:

    $ catmandu convert MARC --fix myfixes.txt < data.mrc

Fixes can also be turned into executable scripts by adding a bash 'shebang' line at the top. E.g. to harvest records from an OAI repository write this fix file:

     #!/usr/bin/env catmandu run
     do importer(OAI,url:"http://lib.ugent.be/oai")
        add_to_exporter(.,JSON)
     end

Run this (on Linux) by setting the executable bit:

     $ chmod 755 myfix.fix
     $ ./myfix.fix

To experiment with the Fix language you can also run the catmandu Fix interpreter in an interactive mode:

     $ catmandu run
     Catmandu 0.95 interactive mode
     Type: \h for the command history
     fix > add_field(hello,world)
     ---
     hello: world
     ...
     fix >

Catmandu contains many powerful fixes. Visit L<http://librecat.org/assets/catmandu_cheat_sheet.pdf> to get an overview what is possible.

=head1 Documentation

For more information read our L<documentation pages|http://librecat.org/Catmandu/> and L<blog|https://librecatproject.wordpress.com/> for a complete introduction and update into all Catmandu features.

In the winter of 2014 an Advent calendar tutorial was created to provide a day by day introduction into the UNIX command line and Catmandu:

L<https://librecatproject.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/day-6-introduction-into-catmandu/>

If you need extra training, our developers regulary host workshops at library conferences and events: L<http://librecat.org/events.html>

=head1 Installation

There are several ways to get a working version of Catmandu on your computer.

For a quick and demo installation visit our L<blog|https://librecatproject.wordpress.com/get-catmandu/> where a VirtualBox image is available containing all the Catmandu modules, including ElasticSearch and MongoDB. A similarly easy method is using L<Docker|https://www.docker.com/>: At L<librecat/catmandu|https://hub.docker.com/r/librecat/catmandu/> a Docker image is provided with version tags for each release, C<latest> for the latest release and C<dev> for the latest development version. The image can be tried online in a Jupyter notebook L<via binder|https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/LibreCat/catmandu-notebook/master>.

On our L<website|http://librecat.org/Catmandu/#installation> we provide installation instructions for:
