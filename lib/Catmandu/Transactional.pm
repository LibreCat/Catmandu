=head2 transaction($sub)

C<transaction> takes a coderef that will be executed in the context of a
transaction. If an error is thrown, the transaction will rollback. If the code
executes successfully, the transaction will be committed. There is no support
for nested transactions, nested calls to C<transaction> will simply be subsumed
by their parent transaction.
