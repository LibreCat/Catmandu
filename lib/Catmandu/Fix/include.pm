=head1 NAME

Catmandu::Fix::include - include fixes from another file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    include('/path/to/myfixes.txt')

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item path is relative to a Catmandu load path

    #1. a catmandu load path is a directory where a catmandu configuration file can be found
    #2. as there are multiple load paths, it will loop through all the path, and include the first file it can find
    #3. in catmandu, the default_load_path is either
    #   3.1. the directory of the running script
    #   3.2. the parent directory of the running script if the directory is 'bin'

    #use default load_path
    #called from script "/opt/catmandu-project/fix.pl"
    #default_load_path: /opt/catmandu-project
    #file must be located at "/opt/catmandu-project/fixes/myfixes.txt"
    Catmandu->fixer("include('fixes/myfixes.txt')");

    #use default load_path
    #called from script "/opt/catmandu-project/bin/fix.pl"
    #default_load_path: /opt/catmandu-project (notice the absence of 'bin')
    #file must be located at "/opt/catmandu-project/fixes/myfixes.txt"
    Catmandu->fixer("include('fixes/myfixes.txt')");

    #load fixes, located at /opt/catmandu-project/fixes/myfixes.txt
    Catmandu->load("/opt/catmandu-project");
    Catmandu->fixer("include('fixes/myfixes.txt')");

    #look for 'fixes/myfixes.txt' in /opt/catmandu-project2, and if that fails in /opt/catmandu-project-1
    Catmandu->load("/opt/catmandu-project2","/opt/catmandu-project-1");
    Catmandu->fixer("include('fixes/myfixes.txt')");

    #if "/opt/catmandu-project/fixes/myfixes2.txt" does not exists, the fix will fail
    Catmandu->load("/opt/catmandu-project");
    Catmandu->fixer("include('fixes/myfixes2.txt)");


=item circular references are not detected

=item if the 'include' is enclosed within an if-statement, the fixes are inserted in the control structure, but only executed if the if-statement evaluates to 'true'.

    #the fixes in the file 'add_address_fields.txt' are only executed when field 'name' has content,
    #but, the fixes are included in the control structure.
    if all_match('name','.+')
        include('add_address_fields.txt')
    end
